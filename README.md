# ttt2-role-arac
This is a custom role for TTT2 called tha Arachnid.

They are a special role on the Traitor team that can climb walls and obscure bodies in webbing in order to make them unsearchable!

Has the Arachnid made a body unsearchable? Don't fret! Just chuck the body into a source of fire and watch as the webbing burns right off!
